Create a table named tblEmp and insert some data by using following script:

CREATE TABLE [dbo].[tblEmp](
    [ntEmpID] [bigint] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    [vcName] [varchar](100) NULL,
    [vcMobieNumer] [varchar](15) NULL,
    [vcSkills] [varchar](max) NULL,
    [moSalary] [money] DEFAULT(0) NOT NULL,
    [ntLevel] [bit] DEFAULT(0) NOT NULL
)

--Inserting demo data
INSERT [dbo].[tblEmp] VALUES
    ('Scott','123-456-3456','CF,HTML,JavaScript',50,0),
    ('Greg',NULL,'HTML5,JavaScript,Jquery',80,0),
    ('David','123-456-3458','Sql,JavaScript',30,1),
    ('Alan','123-456-3459','C#,VB,XQuery',60,1),
    ('Jhon',NULL,'XML,HTML',80,1),
    ('Alan','123-456-3461','Sql,Oracle,DB2',70,1)
        

Assignment:

/* SELECT Clause  */

1. Write a single sql query with following information's:

a. Total number number of employees
b. Minimum salary received by any employees.
c. Total distinct ntLevel

Ans:-SELECT COUNT(ntEmpID),MIN(moSalary),COUNT(DISTINCT(ntLevel)) FROM tblEmp; 
           
/* FROM clause */

2. Correct this query:

    SELECT [ntEmpID], E.[vcName],tblEmp.[vcMobieNumer]
    FROM tblEmp E
Ans:-SELECT [ntEmpID], E.[vcName],E.[vcMobieNumer]FROM tblEmp AS E;
        
/* WHERE clause */
        
3. Write a single select query which satisfies the following conditions:
    a. If any employee does not have a phone number then select that employee if ntLevel  equal to 1
    b. else select those employees whose ntLevel is equal to 0   
        
Ans:-SELECT * FROM tblEmp WHERE (vcMobieNumer is NULL AND ntLevel=1) OR (vcMobieNumer is NOT NULL AND ntLevel=0);
    
/*  ORDER BY clause */

4.  Write a sql query which displays those employee data first, who knows javascript.

Ans:-SELECT * FROM tblEmp ORDER BY CASE WHEN vcSkills LIKE '%JavaScript%' THEN 1 ELSE 2 END;
        
/* TOP  clause */
    
5. Explain the TOP clause in the following sql queries?
    
    a. SELECT TOP(1) * FROM tblEmp 
	ANS:-Selects first 1 row from table tblEmp. 
    b. SELECT TOP(SELECT 3/2) * FROM tblEmp 
	ANS:-Selects first (integer value of(3/2)=1) rows from table tblEmp.
    c. SELECT TOP(1) PERCENT * FROM tblEmp
	ANS:-Selects first 1 percent(nearest greatest integer) of rows from table tblEmp.
    d. SELECT TOP(1) WITH TIES * FROM tblEmp ORDER BY vcName
	ANS:-Selects first 1 row(s) from table tblEmp in Ascending Order of vcName and also selects the row which has same vcName as the Selected row.So,in this case,it shows 2 rows with same vcName.
        
/* GROUP BY/HAVING I know we did not discuss this, but do if you can!*/

6. When I executed this query:
           
   SELECT [vcName],[vcMobieNumer] FROM [dbo].[tblEmp] GROUP BY [vcName]
           
    I got following error message:
    Column 'dbo.tblEmp.vcMobieNumer' is invalid in the select list because it is not contained in either an aggregate function or the GROUP BY clause.

    Can you explain above error message? Write at least two possible solutions. 
	
	ANS:-the GROUP BY clause is used along with the Aggregate functions like COUNT(),AVG(),MAX(),MIN() etc.. or use such select conditions which return a single value. eg:-
			SELECT AVG(moSalary),[vcName] FROM [dbo].[tblEmp] GROUP BY [vcName];
			SELECT [vcName] FROM [dbo].[tblEmp] GROUP BY [vcName];

 
        
7. Write a sql query to get the ntLevel of the employees getting salary greater than average salary.
	ANS:-SELECT ntLevel FROM tblEmp WHERE moSalary>(SELECT AVG(moSalary) FROM tblEmp);
          
Do the following questions using AdventureWorks DB
-------------------------------------------------------
8. Write a query to get the count of employees with a valid Suffix 
ANS:-		use AdventureWorks2012;
		SELECT COUNT(Suffix) FROM Person.Person WHERE Suffix IS NOT NULL;


9. Using BusinessEntityAddress table (and other tables as required), list the full name of people living in the state of Florida

ANS:-	use AdventureWorks2012;
	SELECT P.FirstName,P.MiddleName,P.LastName FROM
	((( Person.Person AS P INNER JOIN Person.BusinessEntityAddress AS B ON P.BusinessEntityID=B.BusinessEntityID)
	INNER JOIN Person.Address AS A ON B.AddressID=A.AddressID)
	INNER JOIN Person.StateProvince AS S ON A.StateProvinceID=S.StateProvinceID)
	 WHERE S.Name='Florida';


10. Show the CompanyName for James D. Kramer
	For each order show the SalesOrderID and SubTotal calculated two ways:
A) From the SalesOrderHeader
B) Sum of OrderQty*UnitPrice
All above must be in 1 query.

ANS:-	SELECT D.SalesOrderID,H.SubTotal,SUM(D.OrderQty*D.UnitPrice) AS Subtotal FROM Sales.SalesOrderDetail AS D 
	INNER JOIN Sales.SalesOrderHeader AS H ON D.SalesOrderID=H.SalesOrderID GROUP BY D.SalesOrderID,H.SubTotal;


11. "Single Item Order" is a customer order where only one item is ordered. Show the SalesOrderID and the UnitPrice for every Single Item Order.

ANS:-SELECT SalesOrderID,UnitPrice FROM Sales.SalesOrderDetail WHERE OrderQty=1;

12. Show the product description for culture 'fr' for product with ProductID 736.

ANS:-SELECT D.Description FROM 
	((Production.ProductDescription AS D
	INNER JOIN Production.ProductModelProductDescriptionCulture AS M ON D.ProductDescriptionID=M.ProductDescriptionID)
	INNER JOIN Production.Product AS P ON P.ProductModelID=M.ProductModelID) 
	WHERE M.CultureID='fr' AND P.ProductID=736;

13. Show OrdeQty, the Name and the ListPrice of the order made by CustomerID 635
	
ANS:-	SELECT D.OrderQty,P.Name,P.ListPrice FROM ((Production.Product AS P 
	INNER JOIN Sales.SalesOrderDetail AS D ON P.ProductID=D.ProductID)
	INNER JOIN Sales.SalesOrderHeader AS H ON D.SalesOrderID=H.SalesOrderID)
 	WHERE H.CustomerID=635;

14. How many products in ProductSubCategory 'Cranksets' have been sold to an address in 'London'?
	
ANS:- 	SELECT SUM(D.OrderQty) FROM
  	((((Sales.SalesOrderHeader AS H INNER JOIN Person.Address AS A ON H.ShipToAddressID=A.AddressID)
  	INNER JOIN Sales.SalesOrderDetail AS D ON H.SalesOrderID=D.SalesOrderID)
  	INNER JOIN Production.Product AS P ON D.ProductID=P.ProductID)
  	INNER JOIN Production.ProductSubcategory AS S ON S.ProductSubcategoryID=P.ProductSubcategoryID)
  	WHERE A.City='London' and s.Name='Cranksets' ;

15. Describe Char, Varchar and NVarChar datatypes with examples. 

ANS:- NvarChar can store unicode values but Char and Varchar cannot.
Char is a fixed width data type.It will reserve the storage space specified by the user even if it is not used. 
Varchar and NVarchar will only use up spaces to store values.It won't reserve spaces like Char.
storage size of :-
char=Defined Width
Varchar=2 bytes + number of chars
NVarchar=2 bytes + Twice the no. of chars
eg:-

	CREATE TABLE Test(
	Column_1 CHAR (10),
	Column_2 VARCHAR(10),
	Column_3 NVARCHAR(10),
	);
	INSERT INTO Test
	VALUES("string 1","string 2","Some unicode");
